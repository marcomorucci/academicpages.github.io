I'm a third year PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke University, where I work with [Devlab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com/) and the [Prediction Analysis Lab](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/lab.html). My main research interests are Political Methodology and Comparative Politics. In Political Methodology I research ways to make Causal Inference robust to different analysis choices, as well as methods to perform causal analyses with non-experimental data. In Comparative Politics I'm interested in the effects of foreign aid on several development outcomes such as conflict and growth. I've also worked on Illicit Financial Flows, in collaboration with the World Bank. Before coming to Duke, I was fortunate to work for the [Parliamentary Candidates UK project](http://parliamentarycandidates.org/), at University College London.
