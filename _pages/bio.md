I'm a PhD candidate in political methodology at the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.duke.edu/) at Duke University. I research methods for empirical political science in settings in which data is scarce and causal inference is hard. I address problems in this setting by combining machine learning and causal inference methodology. I also work with [David Siegel](https://sites.duke.edu/daveasiegel/) on understanding the causes and consequences of mass public action, and I'm  affiliated with the Department of Computer Science, where I work with Cynthia Rudin's [Prediction Analysis Lab](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/lab.html), and the inter-departmental [Almost Matching Exactly Lab](https://almostmatchingexactly.github.io/). As part of these groups, I work on developing fast, accurate and interpretable matching methods for causal inference. As part of [Devlab@Duke](https://www.devlabduke.com/), I worked on Illicit Financial Flows, in collaboration with the World Bank.
